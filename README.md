Javascript computer game project for DU coding bootcamp 12/19

12/28/19
Finally got back from my holiday vacation in order to spend more time on this project. I was actually able to get the if/else statements to function the way they should and display the correct messages based on the player's guess. I still need to write and wire the functions that will subtract from the player's total guesses until they run out and lose the game and also record the number of wins and losses, but so far I'm very happy to have gotten the first part working. This remains an ongoing WIP!

I've been so busy in the couple of weeks leading up to the holidays that I haven't had much time to work on this assignment, and when I have had a chance to sit down and code, Javascript fights me to the death. This game is very much incomplete and a lot of its functions don't work, but I'm not going to stop working on it until I get everything set up right! What I still need to work on as of 12/21:

1) I can't seem to get my if/else statements to display the right message if the player's guess is correct, too high, or too low- I'm only getting the message of the last 'else' statement in the sequence. Not sure if I have one too many curly braces or if the block is inside the wrong scope, or what. Also tried to get the form to reset after the player types in their guess, but that effect doesn't seem to work at the moment, either.

2) Still need to set up for loops to track the number of guesses the player has left, as well as to count the number of wins and losses during a round.

3) Good news is I was able to console log the computer's number and my number guess successfully, so that was nice.

And then I ran out of time. I'll keep working though and continue updating as I go!

Oh by the way, this is a numbers game now, not a word game. I figured I'd start as simple as possible while I still don't have the greatest understanding of Javascript and how the different functions and variables and lines of code all connect. I did attempt the recommended game, but switched to the simple assignment after realizing I needed something a little bit easier to start with.
